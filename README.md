Build Your Own Website - A Beginner's Guide
===========================================

Overview
--------

*Build Your Own Website* is a short tutorial/workshop for **complete beginners** in HTML and websites. It covers the very basics of HTML, and ends with creating a WordPress.com blog website.

Although few websites these days use hand-crafted HTML, I believe it is still important and useful to learn the basics of HTML as a conceptual and pragmatic foundation for websites built in tools such as WordPress.

By starting with HTML, we can 'demystify' the apparently complexity of websites.
